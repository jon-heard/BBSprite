	What this is
		short paragraph description
	Why you should care
		Prototyping
			Quickly drop BbSprites into your scene to test AI or mockup a flavorful setting
			HUGE library of free sprites available for prototyping on google images
			Animating 2d frames quick and painless
			Use concept art in your prototype
		Production
			Simple and painless to use
			Rapid 3d production time: great results without a lot of tweaking
