<h2>Description</h2>
<div style="margin-left:2em;">
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">A plugin for <a href='https://unity3d.com/' target='_blank' style='color:black;text-decoration:underline;'>Unity 3D</a> to make it easy to create and script <a href='http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/5959/rendering-2d-sprites-into-a-3d-world' target='_blank' style='color:black;text-decoration:underline;'>billboarded sprites</a> or "Z-sprites".  The spritesheet is assigned as any other texture in Unity (drag and drop).  Its layout is auto-detected correctly most of the time.  Animations are simply a list of cell indices.

<h2>Challenges</h2>

In the interest of making this plugin as intuitive as possible, I had to dig into Unity3D beyond the documentation.  A few hacks were required in the name of intuitive UI.
